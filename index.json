[{"content":"Creating Tables in SQL New tables are defined in a database by entering a CREATE TABLE statement. In its simplest form, the CREATE TABLE statement includes a new table name and one or more column definitions. Tables are removed using the DROP TABLE statement.\nSQL Syntax for Creating Tables:\n1 2 3 4 5 CREATE TABLE table_name ( column1 datatype constraints, column2 datatype constraints, ... ); table_name: The name of the table you want to create. column1, column2, etc.: The names of the columns in the table. datatype: The data type for each column (e.g., INT, VARCHAR, DATE, etc.). constraints: Optional constraints (discussed in the next section) Example: Creating a simple table with basic columns:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 CREATE TABLE Employees ( EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY, FirstName VARCHAR(50), LastName VARCHAR(50), Salary DECIMAL(10, 2), HireDate DATE ); You can check the structure of a specific table using the DESCRIBE statement. For example,\n1 2 # Show characteristics of table fields DESCRIBE customers; SQL Integrity Constraints SQL constraints are rules and conditions applied to tables and columns to ensure the accuracy, integrity, and consistency of data stored in the database. Constraints define limitations or requirements for the data that can be inserted, updated, or deleted in a database table. Here are common SQL constraints and their definitions:\nDEFAULT:\nPurpose: The DEFAULT constraint is used to specify a default value for a column when a new record is inserted into a table if no explicit value is provided for that column. Example: 1 2 3 4 5 CREATE TABLE Employees ( EmployeeID INT, FirstName VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT \u0026#39;John\u0026#39;, LastName VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT \u0026#39;Doe\u0026#39; ); NOT NULL:\nPurpose: The NOT NULL constraint ensures that a column cannot contain NULL values, meaning it must have a value in every row. Example: 1 2 3 4 CREATE TABLE Customers ( CustomerID INT NOT NULL, FirstName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, LastName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL); UNIQUE:\nPurpose: The UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column are unique across all rows in the table. It enforces data integrity by preventing duplicate values. Example: 1 2 3 CREATE TABLE Products ( ProductID INT UNIQUE, ProductName VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE); CHECK:\nPurpose: The CHECK constraint is used to specify a condition that values in a column must meet. If the condition evaluates to false, the insertion or update operation is rejected. Example: 1 2 3 4 CREATE TABLE Orders ( OrderID INT, OrderDate DATE CHECK (OrderDate \u0026gt;= \u0026#39;2023-01-01\u0026#39;) ); INDEX:\nPurpose: The INDEX constraint is not an integrity constraint itself, but it is used to improve query performance. It creates an index on one or more columns, allowing for faster data retrieval. Example: 1 CREATE INDEX idx_ProductName ON Products (ProductName); PRIMARY KEY (PK):\nPurpose: The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each record in a table. It enforces the uniqueness of values in the specified column(s) and ensures that they are not NULL. Example: 1 2 3 CREATE TABLE Students ( StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY, StudentName VARCHAR(50)); PK can be made of a single field (like in the example above) or multiple columns, as shown below.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 CREATE TABLE Orders ( OrderID INT, ProductID INT, Quantity INT, PRIMARY KEY (OrderID, ProductID) ); FOREIGN KEY (FK):\nPurpose: The FOREIGN KEY constraint establishes a link between two tables by defining a relationship between a column in one table (the child table) and the primary key column in another table (the parent table). It enforces referential integrity, ensuring that values in the child table match values in the parent table. Example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 CREATE TABLE Orders ( OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY, CustomerID INT, OrderDate DATE, FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID) ); In the table above, the CustomerID column in the Orders table is a foreign key that references the CustomerID primary key in the Customers table, creating a relationship between the two tables.\n","permalink":"https://kipronokoech.github.io/posts/sql/8_defining_database_object/","summary":"Creating Tables in SQL New tables are defined in a database by entering a CREATE TABLE statement.

The DELETE statement allows you to specify a condition that identifies the rows to be deleted. Be cautious when using the DELETE statement, as it can permanently remove data from your table.\nDeleting Rows with a Condition To delete rows that meet specific criteria, you can use the DELETE statement with a WHERE clause. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example:\n1 2 -- Delete all customers with age greater than 60 DELETE FROM customers WHERE age \u0026gt; 60; Deleting All Rows To delete all rows from a table, you can use the DELETE statement without a WHERE clause. Be careful when using this, as it will remove all data from the table.\n1 2 -- Delete all rows from the orders table DELETE FROM orders; Updating Rows in SQL To modify existing data in SQL tables, you can use the UPDATE statement. The UPDATE statement allows you to change the values of one or more columns in existing rows.\nUpdating Rows with a Condition To update rows that meet specific criteria, you can use the UPDATE statement with a WHERE clause. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example:\n1 2 -- Update the salary for customers with an age greater than 30 UPDATE customers SET salary = 3000 WHERE age \u0026gt; 30; Updating All Rows To update all rows in a table, you can use the UPDATE statement without a WHERE clause. Be cautious when using this, as it will modify all rows in the table.\n1 2 -- Update all order amounts to 5000 in the orders table UPDATE orders SET amount = 5000; These are basic examples of how to delete and update rows in SQL. Always exercise caution when modifying data, especially when using DELETE without a WHERE clause or when updating multiple rows.\n","permalink":"https://kipronokoech.github.io/posts/sql/9_maintaining_tables/","summary":"Before we learn how to update data in SQL tables, let\u0026rsquo;s create two tables we will use: customers and orders.\ncustomers table 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 USE ds2; # select database show tables; CREATE TABLE customers ( id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL, age INT DEFAULT - 99, address VARCHAR(45), salary DECIMAL(18 , 2 ) DEFAULT 2000.00 ); orders table 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 CREATE TABLE orders ( id INT NOT NULL, date datetime, customer_id INT REFERENCES customers (id), amount DOUBLE, PRIMARY KEY (id) ); Inserting Rows Updating Rows New rows may be inserted into a table one at a time using the SQL INSERT statement.

In the examples below, each clause is shown on a separate line; keywords appear in all uppercase letters, parameters in all lowercase letters.\nClauses The various clauses of SQL statements are named after their initial words: the SELECT clause, for example, or the FROM clause. SQL allows multiple clauses per line, but most SQL programmers use separate lines for clarity and ease of editing.\nKeywords SQL reserves a small number of words, called keywords, for specific purposes. Keywords can be entered ni upper, lower, or mixed-case letters; they are shown here in all uppercase. Keywords may not be used as table or column names.\nParameters Parameters are the \u0026lsquo;variable\u0026rsquo; parts of each clause. When formulating a SQL statement, you insert the appropriate column names, table names, and other such values in place of the lowercase parameters shown above.\nBasic Queries Let\u0026rsquo;s create a databased called \u0026lsquo;ds2\u0026rsquo;\n1 CREATE DATABASE ds2; [Info] At this point load the data from CSV into MySQL ds2 database (see Figure below).\nThe CSV files are here and from them you should be able to create 3 tables in ds2: accounts, angaza_users and payments.\nWe need to fix the registration_date field on accounts table - dates in SQL should be in the format yyyy-mm-dd. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to understand this for now. Just run the query on MySQL Workbench (or alternatives).\n1 2 UPDATE accounts SET registration_date = STR_TO_DATE(registration_date, \u0026#39;%d/%m/%Y\u0026#39;); Selecting All Columns \u0026amp; Rows - using asterisk (*) The following query fetches all rows and all columns from account table. 1 2 SELECT * FROM accounts Show the first 7 using LIMIT clause. 1 2 3 SELECT * FROM accounts LIMIT 7 Key points:\nSyntax 1 2 SELECT * FROM table_name All queries have SELECT and FROM clauses The FROM clause follows the SELECT clause The asterisk (*) means \u0026lsquo;all columns\u0026rsquo; The table name is specified in the FROM clause Columns and rows appear in arbitrary order You can show the first x rows using the LIMIT clause. Questions:\nFetch all rows and columns from angaza_users table Show the first 15 records on payments table. Selecting Specific Columns To select specific columns, we enter a list of columns in the SELECT statement (instead of an asterisk).\nEach column name is separated from the others by a comma and optional spaces. The columns are displayed in the order listed.\n1 2 SELECT angaza_id, area, daily_price FROM accounts; 1 2 SELECT user FROM angaza_users; The SQL query selects all columns for each user from the \u0026ldquo;angaza_users\u0026rdquo; table, including the \u0026ldquo;user\u0026rdquo; column. In this case, \u0026ldquo;user\u0026rdquo; field will appear twice.\n1 2 SELECT user,* FROM angaza_users; Key Points:\nSyntax 1 2 SELECT col1_name, col2_name, col4_name FROM table_name Column names are listed in the SELECT clause Column names are separated by commas Columns appear in the order listed Rows appear in arbitrary order Question:\nShow the area and country of all accounts. Selecting Specific Rows Rows in a table are identified by the values they contain.\nIt is therefore important to understand the different categories of values that SQL supports, and the appropriate syntax for entering each kind of value in query statements.\n1. Numeric values are entered in the normal way That is 76, -4, 3.142, etc Note: Note that commas, dollar signs, and percent signs are not allowed in numeric values. 2. Non-numeric values are enclosed in quotes Non-numeric values, called strings, are entered inside of single quote marks. Use two consecutive single quote marks inside a string to represent a single quote. 3. Date values are entered in \u0026lsquo;yyyy-mm-dd\u0026rsquo; format Dates must be enclosed in single quotes. One more piece before we are ready to select specific rows - comparison and comparison operators. A comparison is a phrase that consists of a column name, a comparison operator, and a value. Al comparisons yield a result of either true or false. Comparisons are used to specify which rows of a table should be included in the result of a query. Comparisons are specified in the WHERE clause of a SQL SELECT statement. The WHERE clause must immediately follow the FROM clause. The result table includes all the rows of the source table where the comparison is true.\nSelect accounts from Kenya\n1 2 3 SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE country=\u0026#39;Kenya\u0026#39; ; Fetch accounts registered on Sept 1, 2023 and onwards 1 2 3 SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE registration_date\u0026gt;=\u0026#39;2023-09-01\u0026#39;; Query all disabled accounts (whose days to cut off is under 0) 1 2 3 SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE days_to_cutoff\u0026lt;0; Key Points:\nSyntax: 1 2 3 SELECT column_list FROM table_name WHERE \u0026lt;condition\u0026gt;; The WHERE clause follows the FROM clause Comparisons are entered in the WHERE clause Rows where the comparison is true are displayed Question:\nSelect all accounts except those registered in Tanzania.

Show all cluster leaders on angaza_users table. Cluster leaders are tagged \u0026ldquo;Cluster Leader\u0026rdquo; in field_level. Sorting Rows To sort the rows of a result table, use the ORDER BY clause. This optional clause must be the last clause in a query.\nColumn names, column positions in the SELECT clause, and the keyword DESC (descending) can be entered as parameters. The default ordering is ASC (asending).\nSelect accounts registered in Tongareni and sort the results in descending order based on days_to_cutoff.\n1 2 3 4 5 SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE area=\u0026#39;Tongareni\u0026#39; ORDER BY days_to_cutoff DESC LIMIT 7; Fetch accounts registered in Morogoro, then sort the accounts in ascending order based on follow_on_paid field.\n1 2 3 4 5 SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE area=\u0026#39;Morogoro\u0026#39; ORDER BY follow_on_paid LIMIT 10; Sort payments in ascending order based on column at position 2 (angaza_id)\n1 2 3 4 5 SELECT account_angaza_id, angaza_id, amount_towards_follow_on FROM payments WHERE effective_date=\u0026#39;2023-09-29\u0026#39; ORDER BY 2 LIMIT 10; Key Points:\nSyntax: 1 2 3 4 SELECT col_list FROM table_name WHERE condition ORDER BY field DESC; The ORDER BY clause must be last A column name or position can be specified DESC indicates a descending sort and ASC keyword means sort in ascending order. Rows in a result table can be ordered based on the values in more than one column by entering a column list in the ORDER BY clause. The left-to-right order of the columns indicates the major-to-minor sort sequence.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 SELECT account_angaza_id, angaza_id, effective_date, amount_towards_follow_on FROM payments ORDER BY 2, 1, 3; 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 SELECT angaza_id, registration_date, upfront_price, days_to_cutoff FROM accounts WHERE area=\u0026#39;Ilorin\u0026#39; ORDER BY upfront_price ASC, days_to_cutoff DESC; Key Points:\nSyntax: 1 2 3 4 SELECT col_list FROM table_name WHERE condition ORDER BY field1, field2 [DESC]; A column list is allowed in the ORDER BY clause Column names are separated by commas Columns are listed in major-to-minor sequence Question:\nShow all columns on angaza_users, sort cluster in descending order and user in ascening order. Eliminating Duplicate Rows Typically, tables do not contain duplicate rows. Queries, however, may result in duplicate rows when a subset of the columns is selected. The keyword DISTINCT is used in the SELECT clause to prevent the display of duplicate rows in a result table.\n1 2 SELECT DISTINCT cluster FROM angaza_users; Key Points:\nSyntax: 1 2 3 4 SELECT [DISTINCT] cols_list FROM table_name WHERE conditions ORDER BY col1 [ASC|DESC], col2 [ASC|DESC] DISTINCT is entered after the keyword SELECT DISTINCT eliminates duplicate rows DISTINCT may only be entered once in a query Questions:\nList all distinct countries in accounts table.

Install UFW: sudo apt install ufw, Check if UFW is running: sudo ufw status, Start UFW: sudo ufw enable, When the VPS is set up for IPv6, make sure to confirm that UFW is set up to handle IPv6 as well: sudo nano /etc/default/ufw, Allow SSH: sudo ufw allow ssh or sudo ufw allow 22/tcp, The TCP protocol facilitates the communication on port 22 with this instruction. Allow TCP to connect using sudo ufw allow 2222/tcp Revoke permission for SSH: sudo ufw delete allow ssh. The same can be done for TCP.

By default, hugo organizes posts by date.\nIf you want to override that provide the weight: \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; on the front-matter. The smaller the \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; the higher the article in the list. I have provided the value 99 for this article.\nUse at least H2 on the title headings. H1 headings do not show on the Table of Content. Take note.\nPossible Problems you will run into in Hugo and how to self them Problem 1: Module \u0026ldquo;PaperMod\u0026rdquo; is not compatible with this Hugo version; run \u0026ldquo;hugo mod graph\u0026rdquo; for more information.\nSolution 1: Hugo is probably outdated.
